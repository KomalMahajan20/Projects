Objective - To determine profitable zipcodes for investing in 2-bedroom properties on short-term rentals basis within NYC.

Overview:
We have two datasets for our analysis-

Zillow Data: Zip_Zhvi_2bedroom.csv.zip - Zillow provides us an estimate of value for two-bedroom properties. From this dataset, we have considered the cost of the 2 bedroom properties for the NYC zipcodes. It has 8946 records.

Airbnb Data: listings.csv - AirBnB is the medium through which the investor plans to lease out their investment property. This dataset has provided us with the information on the different property types available for short-term rental, price per night to rent out the properties, review score, availability per days and other information. It contains 48,895 records.
